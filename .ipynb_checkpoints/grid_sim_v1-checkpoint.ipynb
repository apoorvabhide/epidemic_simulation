    "We know that immunity isn't a hard bound like that - it keeps decaying over time, and doesn't just disappear one day. To capture this, we use parameters from [this paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00219-6/fulltext). It suggests that the probability of not being reinfected is 1 on Day 1 immediately after recovery, and then it decreases exponentially at a constant rate with a median time to reinfection of 16 months. Consequently, we use a decaying exponential function that starts at 1 and decays with a rate parameter of 0.00144 (fitting the median of 16 months ~ 480 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, a [study from Ethiopia] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8673952/) found that the time to recovery from COVID was roughly symmetrically distributed, with a median of 13 days and an IQR of 9-17. Here, we assume this to be Gaussian, which would mean $d \\sim N (13, 6) $."

    "[This paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606v1.full-text) states that the probability of getting COVID from a \"close/household\" contact was 10.2%, and the probability of getting COVID from a random contact outside the social network (like public transport/healthcare) was ~0.3%. In our model, we assume that the close/household contact is with someone the agent is connected to in their social network, and an outside contact is otherwise. Using these parameters, we get a $\\beta$ = 0.36 and $h = -1.88$. \n",

    "Furthermore, the CoMix paper suggests a lack of uniformity in the number of contacts. The number of contacts is said to have a right-skewed distribution with a long right tail - some individuals report as high as 50 contacts in a day, but the mean number of contacts is ~5 in periods with eased restrictions (and only 13% of individuals had >6 contacts, as shown [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009157/S1281_CoMix_Report_-_high_numbers_of_contacts_SAGE_91.pdf).\n",

    "Clearly, this isn't adequately represented by a lattice where every individual has four contacts in a given day. We model this using an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 (this is a beginning, other choices like negative binomial distribution are also viable)."

    "There is a problem with the earlier logistic regression model when you include a dynamically varying number of social contacts: It explodes. Like, the share of infected in the population goes from ~5-6% to 60% _in a day_, which is clearly unrealistic. I think the increase in the logistic regression (and by extension the value of beta) should probably be much lower in this scenario."
